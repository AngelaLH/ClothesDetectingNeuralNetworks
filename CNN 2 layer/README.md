# Fashion MNIST Neural Network

## To Run The Code

You will be prompted to enter one of 4 different neural network models. (note, it is not case sensitive)
The best performing model is 'FashionCNN2', so we recommend beginning with that model

for example
`We have 4 different models for the Fashion MNIST database, however we recommend selecting FashionCNN2

Please Choose your model by typing either 'FashionCNN2''FashionCNN3''FashionCNN4' or 'VGG': 
fashioncnn2`

The code will run and print every iteration. After the specified number of iterations, a confusion matrix, the accuracy, and the loss will be printed on the command line
2 graphs will also be generated showing the loss and the accuracy
